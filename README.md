The proposed Supermarket Management System aims to bring all supermarket operations into one unified platform, providing a comprehensive solution to the issues faced in the current system. This system, built using C# for both the user interface (GUI forms) and backend logic, with MS Access as the database, will streamline tasks such as inventory management, sales processing, and customer interactions. By offering a centralized interface, it ensures accurate real-time data, improves operational efficiency, and supports better decision-making.

One of the key features of this system is its use of static pages, ensuring a simple and user-friendly experience for clients. Clients can log in or sign up to access the system, providing secure and personalized access. The customer management component of the system will allow clients to store and manage customer data, including purchase history, providing a comprehensive view of customer interactions. 

Inventory management will be greatly improved, as clients can add stock, maintain stock levels, and perform quantity-based updates with automated calculations to ensure accuracy. The product management aspect will include detailed data management with date and time stamps, ensuring that all product information is up-to-date and accurate.
